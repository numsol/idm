### What is IDM? ###

IDM is a serial, plain C implementation of the one-dimensional, discrete,
periodic Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) solved in arbitrary precision with a
4th-order Runge-Kutta integrator.

### Future Work ###

Further improvements might include more complex discrete driver models, various
integrators, an arbitrary number of dimensions, mixed models, and
parallelization.
